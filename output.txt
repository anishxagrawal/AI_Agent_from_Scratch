The National Capital Region (NCR) is a region centered on Delhi, which includes the entirety of Delhi and adjacent districts from the states of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan. The NCR was created in 1985, along with the National Capital Region Planning Board (NCRPB), to plan the development of the region.

**Historical Context**

Delhi has a rich history, and it became the capital of British India. Although Prayagraj briefly served as the capital of India for a day in 1858, Delhi has been the primary capital city for an extended period. On January 26, 1950, the State Emblem of India, featuring the Lion Capital of Ashoka, was adopted, symbolizing the country's rich heritage and commitment to truth and justice.

**Economic Significance**

The Delhi-NCR region has emerged as a significant economic hub, with a combined GDP of $370 billion, surpassing Mumbai as the economic capital of India. This growth is a testament to the region's strategic importance and its potential for further development.

In conclusion, New Delhi is the capital of India, located within the special union territory of Delhi, and is part of the larger National Capital Region (NCR).
